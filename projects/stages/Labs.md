# WIP: FINOS Labs

Experimental or concept Projects may be created with fewer requirements in the [finos-labs](https://github.com/finos-labs/) organsiation, regardless of their topic or complexity.
As projects become more mature they may be become Incubated within the FINOS organisation by [applying to FINOS Labs](https://github.com/finos/community/issues#TODO).

## Objectives

The objective of the finos-labs stage is to enable a cross-industry collaboration to form in the open, then start to work through their concepts freely within the FINOS umbrella.

## Starting of a finos-labs project 

A finos-labs GitHub repo may be started within the scope of an existing project, but new project ideas must be approved by the TOC.

For example:

- An incubating or graduated project that is experimenting with a new idea may want a repo that is not subject to the same requirements as a project in the main [FINOS GitHub Organization](https://github.com/finos).
  - This repo would be created in the finos-labs GitHub organization, but moved into the FINOS  or archived once the experiment concludes or the codebase begins to gather users.
- A SIG may want to collaborate on a new idea that could become a full project.
  - The SIG would request a repo in FINOS labs, including evidence that the necessary criteria has been met.

### Criteria for starting a finos-labs project

To qualify, the project must:

1. Solve a problem that is relevant to the financial services industry.
2. Have a clear scope and objectives.
3. Have maintainers from at least two different organizations, and/or be proposed by a FINOS SIG.

### Maintaining

Normal restrictions on who can maintain or contribute to a labs repo once assigned by lead.
* If a Labs repo has no GitHub activity for 1 year, it qualifies for archival
* If a Labs repo has active users, it should receive TOC oversight or prepare to exit labs
* If a Labs repo is marketed beyond FINOS contributors through promo materials, conference talks, etc., then it must receive TOC oversight. This process is TBD

### Migration out of Labs

1. Apply to become a project in FINOS proper - TOC agreement
2. Recommend for other LF foundation
3. Archive

## Requirements

1. SIG / TOC Agreement
