# TOC Liaison Guide

As a TOC Liaison, your role is to facilitate direct support from the TOC to your assigned projects.

## Liaison Responsibilities

- **Monthly Meetings**: Meet with project leads at least once a month to gather updates and discuss any obstacles.
- **Quarterly Reporting**: Submit a summary of project status to the TOC Chair for inclusion in the quarterly board report.
- **Issue Escalation**: Privately escalate major issues or complaints to the TOC as needed.
- **Project Growth Track**: Ensure that all projects understand the path to [promotion](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/project-lifecycle) or [archival](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/stages/archived/).

## How to meet with your projects

- **Set aside time**: Create a recurring monthly meeting for 60 minutes, though you may not need the whole hour every time.
- **Solicit Updates**: Ask how things are going, what the team is working on, and whether there are any obstacles. Follow up on previous discussions. Take notes for later!
- **Share Knowledge**: If there is interest, volunteer news from across the landscape. This may be your project leads' only practical opportunity to learn about other ongoing efforts!
- **Note Challenges**: Outline a plan of action as needed, and let the project know how you will be supporting them.

## You're not alone!

Remember that the TOC has a wealth of experience in open source, including both project contributions and people management. Be sure to tap into your TOC colleagues however you can to best support your projects! Connecting a project with the right solution is _at least_ as effective as providing the solution yourself.
