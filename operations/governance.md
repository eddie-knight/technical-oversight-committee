# FINOS Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) Governance Document

## Mission

The TOC is the technical arm of the FINOS Governing Board, committed to fostering the growth of FINOS projects. It operates transparently through open discussion, maintaining alignment with FINOS's technical and strategic goals while ensuring the long-term sustainability of projects.

---

## Roles

The TOC consists of three roles: Members, Vice Chair, and Chair. Each role has specific responsibilities and expectations to ensure the effective functioning of the committee. Responsibilities of each role are outlined in the [Responsibilities](#responsibilities) section.

### Member

TOC members are responsible for actively participating in meetings, discussions, and decision-making processes. Members determine FINOS technical standards, enable cross-project collaboration, provide technical guidance, and help resolve disputes when needed.

Members are also expected to equally share the responsibility of serving as liaisons to projects and technical initiatives approved by the governing board. Assignments will be divided among TOC members based on interest, to ensure each technical effort has a dedicated liaison.

### Vice Chair

The TOC Vice Chair supports the Chair in overseeing the smooth functioning of the committee by handling logistical tasks such as scheduling meetings, maintaining attendance, and ensuring documentation is up to date.

The Vice Chair may act as a delegate for the Chair when necessary.

Vice Chairs are appointed by the TOC to one-year terms beginning with the vacancy of the role. Onboarding a new Vice Chair should be prioritized by the outgoing Vice Chair.

### Chair

The TOC Chair is responsible for ensuring the smooth operation and productivity of the Technical Oversight Committee. This includes leading meetings, driving the agenda, overseeing decision-making processes, and ensuring all TOC responsibilities are completed on time.

The Chair also serves as the primary liaison between the TOC and the Governing Board, including presenting a quarterly report summarizing updates from project liaisons.

Chairs are appointed by the TOC to one-year terms beginning with the vacancy of the role. Onboarding a new Chair should be prioritized by the outgoing Chair.

### Terms and Selection Process

- Members: Appointed to two-year terms through the [elections process](/operations/elections/elections.md). 
- Chair and Vice Chair: Starting with vacancy of the role, these positions are appointed by the TOC to one-year terms or until their membership on the TOC ends â€” whichever is first. Voting must be done asynchronously to ensure that all members are notified.
